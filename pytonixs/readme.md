# My Portfolio Website

This project is a combination of what i have learned and goin to learn.

The aim is to disply projects of mine to employers.

This website will be constantly updated as I learn more about Django.

I have used float grid for the layout of this website, instead of using just Bootstrap.

Javascript is for the frontend functionalility of website.

This project has been SASSED(SCSS).
